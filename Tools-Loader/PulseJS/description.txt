PulseJS is a JavaScript executor that allows you to run JavaScript code directly in the browser. It is fully developed in JavaScript and enables users to write, save, and load their own scripts. In addition, PulseJS offers a script hub where pre-made scripts are available, as well as a dedicated cheat hub that contains cheat scripts specifically for web games. These scripts allow users to "hack" various games or modify gameplay elements. The tool is completely free and caters to both beginners who want to quickly try out their own ideas and experienced users who want to share or further develop scripts. This makes PulseJS a flexible and practical solution for testing JavaScript code in the browser and easily modifying games.
